Kling LipSync is an advanced audio-to-video model designed to create lifelike lip movements that perfectly sync with the given audio input.

## Features[](#features)

Kling LipSync is an advanced audio-to-video model designed to create lifelike lip movements that perfectly sync with the given audio input. The lip-sync feature can perfectly synchronize the lip movements of characters in videos generated by Kling AI with locally recorded or online-generated dubbing/singing files, achieving the effect of real people speaking or singing, and making the video appear lifelike!

Naturally and Highly Matched Lip Movements:  
The lip movements of characters in the generated video not only synchronize precisely with the audio but also create unique movement trajectories based on individual facial features and physiological structures, significantly enhancing the video’s naturalness and realism.

Clear Facial Muscle Texture:  
The changes in lip movements accurately drive the facial muscles, adjusting in real-time and meticulously presenting the stretching and contraction of muscles during lip movement, resulting in a highly coordinated visual effect that further enhances the overall realism and immersive quality of the video.

Vivid and Lifelike Imagery:  
The areas outside the face in the generated video remain consistent with the original video, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the original footage, avoiding interference with non-target areas during the generation process, and restoring the original appearance of the video to the greatest extent possible.
